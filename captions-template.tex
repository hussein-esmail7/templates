% Description of THIS file: This is a LaTeX (pronounced `Lah-tech') template
%	document for Theatre Accessibility Performance Captions because typing the
%   script in LaTeX is faster than centering text in PowerPoint in each slide.

% What is LaTeX? definition from https://www.latex-project.org/about
% LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is
%	most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but
%	it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

% Why use LaTeX instead of PowerPoint?
% 1. You don't have to center text manually, LaTeX does it by itself when you
%		tell it to.
% 2. LaTeX doesn't require a Microsoft Office licence to use. It's free for
%		everyone (and part of the Free Open Source Software movement)!
% 3. If you have a table of contents with numbered sections and you add another
%		one in the middle, everything is renumbered automatically
% 4. (The reason why it got me into it) It can be typed in any text editor
%		(though I recommend using VSCode with the "LaTeX Workshop" extension
%		by James Yu).

% This document is formatted so that you can follow along with these comments
%	(starting with a `%') so you know what's happening. You may notice that the
%	lines aren't exceeding 80 characters, and even go to a new line
%	mid-sentence. This is just a personal preference and is not at all required
%	by LaTeX.

% Here is the variables section where you can easily change what parameters
%	are used (aspect ratio of the slides, background colour, text colour,
%	text size, title, etc.)

% =========================== Variables ===========================
\def{\myAspectRatio}{169}        % Aspect ratio
\def{\myColorBackground}{black}  % Background colour
\def{\myColorForeground}{white}  % Text colour
\def{\myFontsize}{30pt}          % Font size
\def{\myParagraphSpacing}{0em}   % Spacing between paragraphs
\def{\myTitle}{Show Title Here}  % Title of show, on the first frame
% =========================== Variables ===========================

% You don't need to worry about this ``Configurations'' section. This is where
% most of the variable values are actually implemented (setting the colours,
% text size, etc.)

% ======================== Configurations ========================
\documentclass[professionalfont, aspectratio=\myAspectRatio]{beamer}
\title{\vspace{-3cm} \\ \myTitle}
\usepackage[fontsize=\myFontsize]{fontsize} % Change font size
\usepackage{siunitx}
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
\usepackage{bm}
\usepackage{parskip}						% No paragraph indentation
\setlength{\parskip}{\myParagraphSpacing}	% Set paragraph spacing
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}	% No navigation symbols
\setbeamercolor{title}{fg=\myColorForeground, bg=\myColorBackground}
\setbeamercolor{normal text}{fg=\myColorForeground, bg=\myColorBackground}
\setbeamercolor{background}{bg=\myColorBackground}
% Prevents word hyphenation
\tolerance=1
\emergencystretch=\maxdimen
\hyphenpenalty=10000
\hbadness=10000
% ======================== Configurations ========================

\begin{document}
% Official beginning of the document.
% Everything before \begin{document} is called the ``Preamble''

% Comments inside this document `environment' do not show in the compiled PDF

% ========================= Title slide ==========================
\begin{frame}       % Whatever is inside this is in one slide.
    \begin{center}  % Centers whatever text is inside
        \myTitle    % Prints variable for the show title
    \end{center}
\end{frame}
% ========================= Title slide ==========================

% CONTINUE HERE

% A normal slide looks like this (without the comment symbols)
% \begin{frame}
%     % Text here
% \end{frame}

% You may notice the text is indented here. This does not show up in the actual
% document. the issue with this is that the text is not centered. For that, we
% want to do something like this:
% \begin{frame}
%     \begin{center}
%         % Text here
%     \end{center}
% \end{frame}

% If you want to have a designated line break on a slide, I recommend using 2
% backslashes ("\\"). In LateX, this means make a new line. here is an example
% of that:
% \begin{frame}
%     \begin{center}
%         This is some text. \\ This is on a new line.
%     \end{center}
% \end{frame}

% There are other special characters that you should be aware of, but it might
% be easier if you search them online as you go. Here are just some until you
% need to search yourself:
% 3 consecutive period dots (``...''): $\ldots$
% Quotation marks: `` for the beginning double quotation marks, and ''
%	for the ending double quotation marks. Same for ` and '.
% Italic text: \textit{Text here}
% Bold text: \textbf{Text here}
% Underlined: \underline{Text here}

% New paragraph: 2 empty lines in between. Ex: If the last word is on line 30,
% line 31 must be empty, and the new paragraph starts on line 32. If there is
% text on line 31, it looks as if it's in the same paragraph (I would also use
% this to your advantage here for readability while typing).

% For italic, bold, underline, etc., if you want multiple, these commands can
% be placed inside one another (order doesn't matter). Example:
% \textbf{\underline{This sentence is bolded and underlined.}}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{center}
        Start typing the script lines here!
    \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{center}

    \end{center}
\end{frame}

\end{document} % Official end of the document.
